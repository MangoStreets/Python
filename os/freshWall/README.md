# GoogleImagesAreMine
When you want a large database of images suppose for training your AI program or other super recreational purposes. You should use me . Seriously !

* # How to Use 
---
The scraper use Beautiful Soup, so you should have to get it with *pip* by pasting this in terminal -->
```
    pip install beautifulsoup4
```

There is a list of names (search queries ) i.e strings in which you have to just enter the names 
Eg : 
```
    query_list = ["Benedict Cumberbatch", "Taylor Swift", "Linus Torvald", "Elon Musk"]
```

Now my scraper will get 100s of images for each of these items Like A Boss ! 

* # Obviously you have to run the script after this by pasting this in terminal -->

```
    python downloader.py
```
